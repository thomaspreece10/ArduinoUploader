ArduinoUploader
============
ArduinoUploader is a utility that is part of Arduino Builder, a fully standalone utility for viewing, compiling and uploading Arduino sketch file and compiled ELF or HEX file (usually bootloader) to Arduino board with Arduino serial programming interface, USBasp or Arduino ISP, without the need for Arduino IDE. This can be easily done with no more than 3 steps. When compiling is required (for uploading sketch file), the utility scans the sketch for referenced libraries and build the necessary libraries automatically.

It was modified by Thomas Preece to remove all user interaction so it could be easily combined with SuperEasy-A4S (https://github.com/thomaspreece10/SuperEasy-A4S)
